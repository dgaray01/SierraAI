What is in academics planning language frenchplacement? Intensive French Language courses at the University incorporate one year of language the normal two semester sequence into one semester They are thus valued at 2 units and are classes that meet 5 days a week with the professor and twice a week in practice sessions with undergraduate TAs This explains the intensive label French 121 The 121 elementary course is for PURE beginners who have never studied the French language and culture or who have had very limited exposure It is not a review course but rather is designed to present the language for the first time to those who have never studied it This is why registration into the course is blocked and requires the permission of Dr Julie Baker French Language Program Director French 221 French 221 is the review course for those with several years 3 and up and sometimes those with 2 years of high school French who have already seen some of the grammar structures such as the pass compos or future tense for example You will rego over with the professor and in the text many of the structures that you have most likely already studied and the course is heavily oriented to developing cultural competence as well The cultural element makes it a very interesting course Students who place beyond French 221 cannot take French 121 or
221 for credit If you have questions about your placement in French 121 or 221 contact Dr Julie Baker The University of Richmond 410 Westhampton Way
